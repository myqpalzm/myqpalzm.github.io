        <p>Hi! I'm Jonathan Franzeli, a front-end developer with a passion for learning new things! I'm currently an undergraduate student looking for opportunities to skill up. I specialize in front-end development, graphic design, and video game development, with an interest in music producing and sound engineering.</p>
        <p>This portfolio website is made with <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, a Javascript framework that I'm currently learning.</p>
        <p>Feel free to take a look at my <a href="/">resume</a>.</p>
